## [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

> Given an array of integers numsÂ and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
> You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
> You can return the answer in any order.

## Ideas

1. one idea is pre-sort the array, and for each number `num`, we just do binary search on the rest of the array, look for `target - num`. However, sorting the array requires `O(nlogn)` time, and it needs extra `O(n)` memory to keep the index mapping before/after the sorting as the question is asking for index pair.

2. another idea is taking the advantages of hash. While scanning the array, we use a dictionary to keep a number - index mapping, and at the same time, look up `target - number` in the dictionary. It can stop early once we find the number pair. We need `O(n)` memory to keep the dictionary, and time complexity is also `O(n)` since it only requires a single scan.

## Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        num_set = dict()
        for idx, num in enumerate(nums):
            if target - num in num_set:
                return [idx, num_set[target - num]]
            # put this after the dict lookup, to avoid the
            # situation where num equals to target - num
            num_set[num] = idx

        # shouldn't reach here
        return [-1, -1]
```
