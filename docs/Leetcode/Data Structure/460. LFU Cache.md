## [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/lfu-cache/)

> Design and implement a data structure for a Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache.

> Implement the LFUCache class:

> - `LFUCache(int capacity)` Initializes the object with the `capacity` of the data structure.
> - `int get(int key)` Gets the value of the `key` if the `key` exists in the cache. Otherwise, returns `-1`.
> - `void put(int key, int value)` Update the value of the `key` if present, or inserts the `key` if not already present. When the cache reaches its `capacity`, it should invalidate and remove the least frequently used key before inserting a new item. For this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys with the same frequency), the least recently used `key` would be invalidated.

> To determine the least frequently used key, a use counter is maintained for each key in the cache. The key with the smallest use counter is the least frequently used key.

> When a key is first inserted into the cache, its use counter is set to `1` (due to the `put` operation). The use counter for a key in the cache is incremented either a `get` or `put` operation is called on it.

> The functions `get` and `put` must each run in O(1) average time complexity.

## Ideas

The class maintains a number of instance members to achieve the functions,

 - capacity: the capacity of the LFU
 - count: a mapping from key to count
 - lookup: a lookup mapping from key to cached value
 - keys: a double linked list that has all the keys in such a order that keys with lower count and recently used come first
 - key_pointers: a dictionary with the format `{key: [start_pointer, end_pointer]}`, both `start_pointer` and `end_pointer` point to `keys`, and all the keys from `start_pointer` to `end_pointer` should have the same count

When search for key, we just increase the count of the key by 1, remove it from the origin place in `keys` and insert it to the correct place in `keys`.

When put a key value pair, we just increase the count of key by 1. If the number of key already excceeds the capacity, we need to evict the least recent used key that has the lowest count.

During the whole process, we need to manage these instance members carefully.

    def _evict_key(self) -> None:
