## [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/)

> You are given an array prices where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i-th` day.

> Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

## Ideas

This one is simple. Just calculate the profit as you go through the prices array, add up the profit you would make every time the price goes up.

## Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        profit = 0
        for idx in range(len(prices) - 1):
            profit += max(0, prices[idx + 1] - prices[idx])

        return profit
```
