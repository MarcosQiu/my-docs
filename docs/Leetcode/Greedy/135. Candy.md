## [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/)

> There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

> You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

> - Each child must have at least one candy.
> - Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

> Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.


## Ideas

This can be done scanning through the array twice. One from left to right, and the second one from right to left.

1. First initialize the candies array, all the children start with 1 candy.
2. When scanning from left to right, if `ratings[idx] < rating[idx + 1]`, then set `candies[idx + 1]` as `candies[idx] + 1`.
3. When scanning from right to left, if `rating[idx - 1] > rating[idx]`, then set `candies[idx - 1]` as `max(candies[idx - 1], candies[idx] + 1)`.

Assume that `rating[i] < rating[i + 1] > rating[i + 2]`, then `candies[i + 1] = candies[i] + 1`. After the second scan, `candies[i + 1]` can only become larger, so the relative order between `candies[i]` and `candies[i + 1]` remains unchanged.

Both time and space time complexity are just O(n).

## Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        candies = [1] * len(ratings)
        for idx in range(len(ratings) - 1):
            if ratings[idx] < ratings[idx + 1]:
                candies[idx + 1] = candies[idx] + 1

        for idx in range(len(ratings) - 1, 0, -1):
            if ratings[idx - 1] > ratings[idx]:
                candies[idx - 1] = max(candies[idx - 1], candies[idx] + 1)

        return sum(candies)
```
