## [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/queue-reconstruction-by-height/)

> You are given an array of people, people, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each `people[i] = [hi, ki]` represents the `ith` person of height `hi` with exactly `ki` other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to `hi`.

> Reconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array people. The returned queue should be formatted as an array queue, where `queue[j] = [hj, kj]` is the attributes of the jth person in the queue (`queue[0]` is the person at the front of the queue).


## Ideas

Becase for each `people[i] = [hi, ki]` represents the `ith` person of height `hi` with exactly `ki` other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to `hi`, so where people with lower height stand doesn't matter for those who taller than him/her. In that case, we want to pre-sort these people so that tallest person at the head of the list. For those have the same height, they are sorted in ascending order based on `k`.

Then just going through the sorted people array. For each `person = [h, k]`, we just insert it to index `k` in result array. 

The time complexity and space complexity are `O(nlogn)` and `O(n)`.

## Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def reconstructQueue(self, people: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        sorted_people = sorted(people, key=lambda p: (-p[0], p[1]))
        res = list()
        for ppl in sorted_people:
            res.insert(ppl[1], ppl)
            
        return res
```
