## [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/)

> Given an array of intervals intervals where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

## Ideas

This question can be solved with greedy. Every time we pick some intervals, we always want the one that has the smallest end index. That simply means we have more space left, and we can keep more non-overlapping intervals.

So we need to pre-sort the intervals based on the end index, and then go through the sorted intervals to decide which part should be kept.

The running time would be `O(nlogn)` because the use of sorting, and we need `O(n)` extra memory space to keep the sorted intervals.

## Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        sorted_intervals = sorted(intervals, key=lambda x: x[1])
        upper_boundary = float('-inf')
        discard_intervals = 0
        for start, end in sorted_intervals:
            if start >= upper_boundary:
                upper_boundary = end
            else:
                discard_intervals += 1

        return discard_intervals
```
