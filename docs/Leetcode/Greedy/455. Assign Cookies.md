## [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/)

> Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

> Each child `i` has a greed factor `g[i]`, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie `j` has a size `s[j]`. If `s[j] >= g[i]`, we can assign the cookie `j` to the child i, and the child `i` will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.


## Ideas

It's kind of straightforward with greedy algorithm. We always want to feed the child with smallest greedy factor by choosing the cookie with smallest possible size.

We use 2 heaps to keep children & cookies in memory for quickly fetching child or cookie with smallest greedy factor/size. So the extra memory space is `O(|g| + |s|)`.

Analysing the time complexity, data copy and heapify take time `O(|g| + |s|)`. For coming up the way to distribute the cookies, the running time is `O(log(|g|))+O(log(|g-1|))+...+O(log1)+O(log(|s|))+O(log(|s-1|))+...+O(log1)`. To simplify,

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?O(log%7Cg%7C)&plus;O(log(%7Cg-1%7C))&plus;...&plus;O(log1)%5C%5C%3E%20O(log%7Cg%7C)&plus;O(log(%7Cg-1%7C))&plus;...&plus;O(log%7Cg/2%7C)%5C%5C%3E%20O(log%7Cg/2%7C)%20*%20g/2%3E%20O((log%7Cg%7C%20-%201)%20*%20(g%20/%202))%5C%5C=%20O(glog%7Cg%7C)%20" /></div>

So the total running time would be `O(log|g| + log|s|)`.

## Solution

```py
import heapq

class Solution:
    def findContentChildren(self, g: List[int], s: List[int]) -> int:
        greedy = g[:]
        size = s[:]
        heapq.heapify(greedy)
        heapq.heapify(size)

        children_fed = 0
        while len(greedy) > 0 and len(size) > 0:
            while len(size) > 0 and size[0] < greedy[0]:
                heapq.heappop(size)
            if len(size) > 0:
                children_fed += 1
                heapq.heappop(greedy)
                heapq.heappop(size)

        return  children_fed
```
