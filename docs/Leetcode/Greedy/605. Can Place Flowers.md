## [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/can-place-flowers/)

> You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

> Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

## Ideas

With greedy algorithm, we just need to scan the flowerbed from left to right, and plant a new flower when possible. At the end, we could know the count of total number of flowers that can be planted.

The running time is obvious O(n), and it only needs constant extra memory space.

## Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        last_planted_idx = -2
        for idx in range(len(flowerbed)):
            if flowerbed[idx] == 1:
                # if this plot is already planted
                last_planted_idx = idx
            elif (
                idx - last_planted_idx > 1 and
                (idx == len(flowerbed) - 1 or flowerbed[idx + 1] != 1)
            ):
                n -= 1
                last_planted_idx = idx

        return n <= 0
```
