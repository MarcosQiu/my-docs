## [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels/)

> You are given a string `s`. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part.

> Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

## Ideas

Since all the same characters should be in one partition, so if `a`'s first appearance is `a-start` and its last appearance is `a-end`, then the substring `s[a-start, ..., a-end]` should be in one partition. Same for the other characters, we can have a range for each one of them.

Then, the problem would be converted to [merge intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/).

The running time for getting those intervals would be `O(n)`, and there are at most 26 lowercase letters, so at most there are 26 intervals, the merging process takes constant time. In conclusion, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`. And the space complexity of `O(1)`.

## Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def partitionLabels(self, s: str) -> List[int]:
        intervals = dict()
        for idx, ch in enumerate(s):
            if ch in intervals:
                intervals[ch][1] = idx
            else:
                intervals[ch] = [idx, idx]

        intervals = sorted(intervals.values(), key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))

        # merge intervals
        current_interval = None
        result = []
        for start, end in intervals:
            if current_interval is not None and start <= current_interval[1]:
                current_interval = (
                    min(current_interval[0], start),
                    max(current_interval[1], end)
                )
            else:
                if current_interval is not None:
                    result.append(current_interval[1] - current_interval[0] + 1)
                current_interval = (start, end)

        result.append(current_interval[1] - current_interval[0] + 1)
        return result
```
