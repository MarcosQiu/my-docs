## [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/)

> A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or null.

> Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly n brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.


## Ideas

The tricky part of the question is handling the random pointer. We can first just copy the list without worry about the random pointer, which is trivial. During the whole process, we can point the random pointer to the corresponding node in the origin list. And also, we can have a dictionary that maps the nodes in origin list to corresponding nodes in new list.

After that, let's then deal with the random pointer. Note that the new nodes' random pointers are pointing to old nodes, and with the dictionary, we can find the node that the random pointer is supposed to pointing to. Assume the new node is n, then we have
```py
# n.random is pointing to corresponding node in
# origin list, so the n.random is supposed to
# point to dict[n.random.random]
n = dict[n.random.random]
```

It's obvious that the time complexity is `O(n)`, since we just need to scan the list twice. And the space complexity is `O(1)`, excluding the memory taken by the new list that is going to returned.

## Solution

```py
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, x: int, next: 'Node' = None, random: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = int(x)
        self.next = next
        self.random = random
"""

class Solution:
    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        new_head = None
        prev_node = None
        current_node = head
        old_new_node_map = dict()
        while current_node is not None:
            node = Node(current_node.val, None, current_node)
            old_new_node_map[id(current_node)] = node
            if new_head is None:
                new_head = node
            if prev_node is not None:
                prev_node.next = node
            prev_node = node
            current_node = current_node.next

        current_node = new_head
        while current_node is not None:
            if current_node.random.random is not None:
                # if the origin node's random pointer is not None
                current_node.random = old_new_node_map[id(current_node.random.random)]
            else:
                current_node.random = None
            current_node = current_node.next

        return new_head
```
