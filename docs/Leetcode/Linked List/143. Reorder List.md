## [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/)

> You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

> ```L[0] → L[1] → … → L[n - 1] → L[n]```

> Reorder the list to be on the following form:

> ```L[0] → L[n] → L[1] → L[n - 1] → L[2] → L[n - 2] → …```

> You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.


## Ideas

1. find the middle point of the list with slow and fast pointers
2. reverse the second half of the list
3. merge the first half and the reversed second part

The time and space complexity are `O(n)` and `O(1)`.


## Solution
```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: ListNode) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
        """
        if head:
            mid = self.getMiddle(head)
            reverse, _ = self.reverse(mid)
            self.merge(head, reverse)

    def reverse(self, head):
        if head is None:
            return None, None
        if head.next is None:
            return head, head
        h, t = self.reverse(head.next)
        t.next, head.next = head, None
        return h, head

    def getMiddle(self, head):
        if head is None:
            return None
        slow = fast = head
        while fast.next and fast.next.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        
        mid = slow.next
        slow.next = None
        return mid

    def merge(self, l1, l2):
        while l1 and l2:
            l1_tmp = l1.next
            l2_tmp = l2.next

            l1.next = l2
            l1 = l1_tmp
            l2.next = l1
            l2 = l2_tmp
```
