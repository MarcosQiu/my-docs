## [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/)

> Write a function to delete a node in a singly-linked list. You will not be given access to the head of the list, instead you will be given access to the node to be deleted directly.

> It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not a tail node in the list.


## Ideas

Since the given node is not a tail node, and we have no access to its parent node. A work around is to copy its next node's value to current node, and delete the next one instead.

## Solution
```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def deleteNode(self, node):
        """
        :type node: ListNode
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify node in-place instead.
        """
        node.val = node.next.val
        node.next = node.next.next
```
