## [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/)

> Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.

> k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

> You mayÂ not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.


## Ideas

The idea is trivial. We can define a helper function, it first count if there are at least k nodes in the list,

1. if there are at least k nodes, it just get the first k nodes from the linked list, reverse the list. Then call the method recursively on the rest part
2. if no, it just return the list as it is

The running time is `O(n)`, and the space complexity is `O(1)`. 

To make it even faster, we can reverse the first k nodes when we are counting. But need to reverse it again if we find out that there are less than k nodes in the list. In this way, the order of time complexity doesn't change, but it's roughly halved.


## Solution
```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseKGroup(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        def helper(head, k):
            first_section_head = None
            first_section_tail = head
            current_node = head
            nodes_in_first_sec = 0

            while nodes_in_first_sec < k and current_node is not None:
                # reverse the first k nodes as we go
                tmp = current_node
                current_node = current_node.next
                tmp.next = first_section_head
                first_section_head = tmp

                nodes_in_first_sec += 1

            if current_node is None:
                if nodes_in_first_sec == k:
                    return first_section_head, first_section_tail
                else:
                    # reverse it back
                    return reverse(first_section_head)
            else:
                h, t = helper(current_node, k)
                first_section_tail.next = h
                return first_section_head, t

        def reverse(head):
            if head is None:
                return None, None
            if head.next is None:
                return head, head
            h, t = reverse(head.next)
            t.next = head
            head.next = None
            return h, head

        new_head, _ = helper(head, k)
        return new_head
```
