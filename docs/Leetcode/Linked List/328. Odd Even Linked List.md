## [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/)

> Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.

> The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.

> Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

> You must solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` time complexity.

## Ideas

1. Scan the list, put elements in odd and even positions to different lists
2. Link the even list at the end of the odd list

## Solution
```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def oddEvenList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        odd_even_lists = [[ListNode(), None], [ListNode(), None]]
        odd_even_lists[0][1] = odd_even_lists[0][0]
        odd_even_lists[1][1] = odd_even_lists[1][0]
        current_node = head
        list_to_append = 0

        while current_node is not None:
            tmp = current_node
            current_node = current_node.next
            tmp.next = None
            odd_even_lists[list_to_append][1].next = tmp
            odd_even_lists[list_to_append][1] = tmp
            list_to_append = 1 - list_to_append

        odd_even_lists[0][1].next = odd_even_lists[1][0].next
        return odd_even_lists[0][0].next
```
