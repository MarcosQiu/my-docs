## [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-binary-search-tree-to-sorted-doubly-linked-list/)


> Convert a Binary Search Tree to a sorted Circular Doubly-Linked List in place.

> You can think of the left and right pointers as synonymous to the predecessor and successor pointers in a doubly-linked list. For a circular doubly linked list, the predecessor of the first element is the last element, and the successor of the last element is the first element.

> We want to do the transformation in place. After the transformation, the left pointer of the tree node should point to its predecessor, and the right pointer should point to its successor. You should return the pointer to the smallest element of the linked list.


## Ideas

Like tree traversal, we can use recursion. Write a helper function, first convert two substrees, than link those 2 linked lists with the root, and return the result list.

The running time should just be `O(n)` where `n` refers to the total number of nodes in the tree.

## Solution
```py
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
"""

class Solution:
    def treeToDoublyList(self, root: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        def helper(root):
            if root is None:
                return [None, None]
            head_left, tail_left = helper(root.left)
            head_right, tail_right = helper(root.right)

            head = root
            tail = root
            if head_left:
                tail_left.right = root
                root.left = tail_left
                head = head_left
            
            if head_right:
                head_right.left = root
                root.right = head_right
                tail = tail_right

            return head, tail

        h, t = helper(root)
        if h:
            h.left = t
            t.right = h
        return h
```
