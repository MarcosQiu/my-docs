## [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers-ii/)

> You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

> You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.


## Ideas

1. reverse two given lists
2. sum these two from the least significant digit
3. reverse the result again and return


## Solution
```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        def reverse(head):
            if head is None:
                return None, None
            if head.next is None:
                return head, head
            h, t = reverse(head.next)
            t.next = head
            head.next = None
            return h, head

        reversed_l1, _ = reverse(l1)
        reversed_l2, _ = reverse(l2)
        
        current_l1 = reversed_l1
        current_l2 = reversed_l2
        reversed_result = ListNode(0)
        current_result = reversed_result
        carry_over = 0
        while current_l1 is not None or current_l2 is not None:
            tmp = (
                (0 if current_l1 is None else current_l1.val) +
                (0 if current_l2 is None else current_l2.val) +
                carry_over
            )
            current_result.next = ListNode(tmp % 10)
            carry_over = tmp // 10
            current_result = current_result.next
            
            current_l1 = None if current_l1 is None else current_l1.next
            current_l2 = None if current_l2 is None else current_l2.next
            
        if carry_over > 0:
            current_result.next = ListNode(carry_over)
            
        result, _ = reverse(reversed_result.next)
        return result
```
