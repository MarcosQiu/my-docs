## [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/)

> You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words` of the same length. Return all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once, in any order, and without any intervening characters.

> You can return the answer in any order.

## Ideas


Since each word should appear exactly the same times as in the given list. So all the matching substrings should have the same length. We can solve the problem with fixed size sliding window. We use a hash map to keep the words and frequencies in the list. For each window, we try to match the substring with the word in the list. And we can move to next substring if the word is not in the list, or the frequency is already larger than the frequency in the given list.

The space complexity would be `O(|words size|)`, which is just the size of the hash map. For the time complexity, there are in total `|s| - |words size| * |words number|` sliding windows. For each sliding window, we try to match the substring, which would cause `O(|words size| * |words number|)` time. So the total run time would be `O(|s| * |words size| * |words number|)`.

## Solutions

```py
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def sameCount(self, count, targetCount):
        for key in targetCount:
            if targetCount[key] != count[key]:
                return False
        return len(count) == len(targetCount)

    def findSubstring(self, s: str, words: List[str]) -> List[int]:
        word_list_count = Counter()
        for word in words:
            word_list_count[word] += 1
        
        word_len = len(words[0])
        word_nums = len(words)

        # sliding windows have fixed length
        start, end = 0, word_len * word_nums - 1
        result = list()
        while end < len(s):
            current_window_word_count = Counter()
            word_start = start
            while word_start <= end:
                word = s[word_start:word_start + word_len]
                if word not in word_list_count:
                    break
                current_window_word_count[word] += 1
                if current_window_word_count[word] > word_list_count[word]:
                    break
                word_start += word_len
            else:
                if self.sameCount(current_window_word_count, word_list_count):
                    result.append(start)

            start += 1
            end += 1

        return result
