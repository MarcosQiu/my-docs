## [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/)

> You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most `k` times.

> Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.

## Ideas 

With sliding window pattern, we can use a hash map to keep all the character frequencies in the window, can keep track of the `maxFrequency`. If we can replace all the other characters with at most `k` operations. 

One thing to notice, While shrinking the window, we donâ€™t need to update `maxFrequency`. Even though current window's actual `maxFrequency` count might be smaller than the number we are tracking, but we know that in one of the previous windows, the actual max frequency count equals to the variable, and that window size is at most current window size. So we can still achieve the longest length by expanding that previous substring if necessary.

## Solution
```py
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        window_start, max_length, max_repeat_letter_count = 0, 0, 0
        frequency_map = Counter()

        for window_end, right_char in enumerate(s):
            frequency_map[right_char] += 1
            # in all the windows, there must be at least one window that
            # has max letter frequency equals to max_repeat_letter_count
            max_repeat_letter_count = max(max_repeat_letter_count, frequency_map[right_char])
            if (window_end - window_start + 1 - max_repeat_letter_count) > k:
                frequency_map[s[window_start]] -= 1
                # since everytime the window shrinks at most once
                # so current window size must be no smaller than
                # all previous windows
                window_start += 1

            max_length = max(max_length, window_end - window_start + 1)
        return max_length
```
