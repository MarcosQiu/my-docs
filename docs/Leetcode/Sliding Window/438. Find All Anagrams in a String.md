## [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string)

> Given two strings `s` and `p`, return an array of all the start indices of `p`'s anagrams in `s`. You may return the answer in any order.

## Ideas

Similar to question [567. Permutation in String](http://yankunqiu.me/Leetcode/Sliding%20Window/567.%20Permutation%20in%20String/). Instead of return `True` when we find a permutation, we just keep the start index along the way.

The time and space complexities are still `O(m + n)` and `O(1)`.


## Solutions
```py
class Solution:
    def findAnagrams(self, s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:
        if len(p) > len(s):
            return []

        word_diff = dict()
        combined = p + s
        left, right = 0, len(p)
        res = list()
        while right < len(combined):
            if combined[left] in word_diff:
                word_diff[combined[left]] -= 1
                if word_diff[combined[left]] == 0:
                    del word_diff[combined[left]]
            else:
                word_diff[combined[left]] = -1

            if combined[right] in word_diff:
                word_diff[combined[right]] += 1
                if word_diff[combined[right]] == 0:
                    del word_diff[combined[right]]
            else:
                word_diff[combined[right]] = 1

            if left + 1 >= len(p) and len(word_diff) == 0:
                res.append(left + 1 - len(p))

            left += 1
            right += 1

        return res
```
