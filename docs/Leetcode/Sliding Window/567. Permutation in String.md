## [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string)

> Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, return true if `s2` contains the permutation of `s1`.

> In other words, one of `s1`'s permutations is the substring of `s2`.


## Ideas

Follow the sliding window pattern, we can combine the pattern `s1` and text `s2`, then we know that in the combined text, the first `s1.length` characters form a permutation (it's just `s1` itself).

Everytime, we just slide this fixed size window one position at a time, keep track of the character difference with a hash map. If we find some window that has no character difference and doesn't include the first `s1.length` characters (the origin `s1`), then we can claim that we found a permutation.

So the time complexity would be `O(m + n)`. As for space complexity, since `s1` and `s2` have only lowercase English letters, it would just be `O(1)`.

## Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def checkInclusion(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        if len(s1) > len(s2):
            return False
        
        word_diff = dict()
        combined = s1 + s2
        left, right = 0, len(s1)
        while right < len(combined):
            if combined[left] in word_diff:
                word_diff[combined[left]] -= 1
                if word_diff[combined[left]] == 0:
                    del word_diff[combined[left]]
            else:
                word_diff[combined[left]] = -1

            if combined[right] in word_diff:
                word_diff[combined[right]] += 1
                if word_diff[combined[right]] == 0:
                    del word_diff[combined[right]]
            else:
                word_diff[combined[right]] = 1

            if left + 1 >= len(s1) and len(word_diff) == 0:
                return True

            left += 1
            right += 1

        return False
```
