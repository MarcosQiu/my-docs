## [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-product-less-than-k/)

> Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is strictly less than `k`.

## Ideas

This follows the sliding window pattern. In each iteration, we increase the right index by 1, and shrink the left index if the product of current subarray is too large. When we find such a subarray, we increase the count by `rightIdx - leftIdx + 1`, this is all the subarrays that end at `rightIdx` and have product less than `k`. For example the array is `[10,5,2,6]` and `k` is 100.

```
left, right=> 10 5 2 6   count is added by 1, the subarray here is [10]
left=>10 right=> 5 2 6   count is added by 2, the subarrays are [10, 5], [5]
10 left=>5 right=> 2 6   count is added by 2, the subarrays are [2, 6], [6]
10 left=>5 2 right=> 6   count is added by 3, the subarrays are [5, 2, 6], [2, 6], [6]
```

The running time here is `O(n)` and it only needs constant extra memory.

## Solutions

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numSubarrayProductLessThanK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int totalCount = 0;
        int leftIdx = 0;
        int windowProduct = 1;
        for(int rightIdx = 0; rightIdx < nums.size(); rightIdx ++) {
            windowProduct *= nums[rightIdx];
            while(leftIdx <= rightIdx & windowProduct >= k) {
                windowProduct /= nums[leftIdx++];
            }
            totalCount += (rightIdx - leftIdx + 1);
        }
        return totalCount;
    }
};
```
