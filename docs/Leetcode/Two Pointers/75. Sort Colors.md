## [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)

> Given an array `nums` with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

> We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

> You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.


## Ideas

We use an index pointing to the first element indicating where `1` should start, and an index pointing to the last element indicating where `1` should end. And with a read index, we can scan the whole array. At any point, from `0` to `firstOneIdx` are all the `0`s, from `firstOneIdx` to `read` are all the `1`s, and from `lastOneIdx` to the end are all the `2`s.

So we can put all the numbers in place with just one scan. The time complexity would be `O(n)` and it only requires constant extra memory.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        int firstOneIdx = 0;
        int lastOneIdx = nums.size() - 1;
        int read = 0;

        while(read <= lastOneIdx) {
            if(nums[read] == 0) {
                int tmp = nums[firstOneIdx];
                nums[firstOneIdx++] = nums[read];
                nums[read] = tmp;
                read ++;
            } else if (nums[read] == 2) {
                int tmp = nums[lastOneIdx];
                nums[lastOneIdx--] = nums[read];
                nums[read] = tmp;
            } else {
                read ++;
            }
        }
    }
};
```
