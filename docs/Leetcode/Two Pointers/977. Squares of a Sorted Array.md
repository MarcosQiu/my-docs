## [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/)

> Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Ideas

We can have a `lo` pointer that points to the first element and a `hi` pointer that points to the last element.

While `lo` pointer is no greater than `hi` pointer, we pick the one that has higher absolute value, which means larger square value. We keep iterating until `lo` and `hi` meet at the center.

The runtime would be `O(n)` and space complexity would be `O(1)`.

## Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def sortedSquares(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = [0] * len(nums)

        lo, hi, write = 0, len(nums) - 1, len(nums) - 1

        while lo <= hi:
            if abs(nums[lo]) >= abs(nums[hi]):
                res[write] = pow(nums[lo], 2)
                lo += 1
            else:
                res[write] = pow(nums[hi], 2)
                hi -= 1
            write -= 1

        return res
```
