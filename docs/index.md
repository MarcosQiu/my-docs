# Welcome! 

This is Yankun


# Motivation
I built this website because I enjoy learning new stuff off work. I think it would be great to have a place that centralizes all my notes, could be accessed through Internet, so that it's for me to look up when necessary. And by building a website like this, it also helps the others who are also interesting in these topics.

I might misunderstand some of the questions/topics/concepts. For any issues or corrections, please [open an issue](https://github.com/MarcosQiu/my-docs/issues/new) in the repository. Thanks you very much, and hope the content is helpful :)

# How I Generate the Website?
I use the static website generator [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org), which is really easy to use and can be customized with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

I also use the icons from [icons8](https://icons8.com/), it provides a huge range of icons with great designs.
